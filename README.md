# Introduction

This repository contains some demonstrations of writing composable data science code using Python and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org).

Jupyter is a blessing and a curse to data science projects. The notebook environment makes it very easy to experiment and explore data, but it also makes productionising the finished product difficult because code responsible for data preparation, feature engineering, analysis, modelling and testing is all mixed together in a homogeneous notebook.

We need code that can be decomposed into simple components that function well together, but without giving up on notebooks. 

# Preparing your Python environment

You'll need to have Python 3 along with `pip` and `virtualenv` installed on your system. To initialise `virtualenv` and install dependencies including Jupyter, run the following:

```
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Subsequently, to activate the environment run `source env/bin/activate` again.
